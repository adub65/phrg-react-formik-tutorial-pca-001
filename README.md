# Formik Tutorial

In this lab you will follow the code-along tutorial provided in `Formik` documentation.

Start by forking and cloning this repository and `cd`ing into the project. Skip the "Setup for this Tutorial" section in the docs, and instead [start right here](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial#overview-what-is-formik). Use `yarn start` to start your local server.

- As you move through the code-along, try to disect each change. Do not blindly copy & paste each new section.
- Check your browser between every modification.
- Be careful not to remove the code at the bottom of `src/index.js` that renders your Virtual DOM.
- Be careful to update your `import` statements appropriately as you move forward.
- When you are done, commit & push your changes, and open a PR. Just like a normal lab.

Happy coding!
